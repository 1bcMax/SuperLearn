## Project Overview

SuperLearn is a **Web3-native educational platform** that empowers kids to learn cryptocurrency and blockchain technology through hands-on experience with an AI mentor. By leveraging **Dynamic's embedded wallet infrastructure**, **Flow blockchain for achievement verification**, and **Nora AI for intelligent development assistance**, we create the first platform where children can safely learn crypto skills through guided, real on-chain interactions.

**One-Line Summary**: AI-powered crypto education where kids learn by doing real blockchain transactions with instant wallet access and permanent achievement records.

## Core Problem Statement

Traditional crypto education relies on theoretical knowledge without practical verification. Kids struggle to understand abstract blockchain concepts while lacking safe environments to practice. Current educational platforms cannot verify if users truly understand crypto operations - they only test memorization, not real-world application skills.

**What makes this different**: SuperLearn verifies understanding through actual blockchain behavior, not quiz scores.
