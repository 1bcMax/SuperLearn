# SuperLearn: Kids Learn Crypto Tech with AI Mentor
## Project Overview

SuperLearn is a **Web3-native educational platform** that empowers kids to learn cryptocurrency and blockchain technology through hands-on experience with an AI mentor. By combining **Dynamic's embedded wallet infrastructure**, **Fetch.ai's intelligent uAgents**, and **Flow's innovative Actions framework (FLIP-338)**, we create the first platform where children can safely learn crypto skills through guided, real on-chain interactions.

**One-Line Summary**: AI-powered crypto education where kids learn by doing real blockchain transactions, not just memorizing theory.

## Core Problem Statement

Traditional crypto education relies on theoretical knowledge without practical verification. Kids struggle to understand abstract blockchain concepts while lacking safe environments to practice. Current educational platforms cannot verify if users truly understand crypto operations - they only test memorization, not real-world application skills.

**What makes this different**: SuperLearn verifies understanding through actual blockchain behavior, not quiz scores.
