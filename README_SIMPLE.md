## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **API Key Problems**
```bash
# Check your API key is set correctly
grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY frontend/.env.local

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
```

#### **CORS Issues**
- Development: Works out of the box
- Production: May need API proxy (we can add if needed)

#### **Dependencies**
```bash
# If you have issues, clean install
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### **Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Check if port 3001 is in use
lsof -i :3001

# Kill process if needed
kill $(lsof -t -i:3001)
```
